# User Segmentation Service (USS)
This repository contains multiple solutions for implementing the User Segmentation Service (USS). Each solution is stored in its own branch, and you can switch between branches to explore each solution.

## Available Solutions

[Solution One](https://github.com/rezasardari/go-challenge/tree/solution-one): Archiving Mechanism with postgres, Load Balancer, Kubernetes, Redis and Golang.

[Solution Two](https://github.com/rezasardari/go-challenge/tree/solution-two): InfluxDB, Redis, Load Balancer, Kubernetes, and Golang.

[Solution Three](https://github.com/rezasardari/go-challenge/tree/solution-three): Event-Driven Architecture with Apache Kafka.

## Choosing the Right Solution
The choice of solution will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your use case. Consider factors such as performance, scalability, and maintainability when deciding which solution is the best fit for your needs.

I recommend starting with Solution One or Two, as they provide a good balance between performance and ease of implementation. If you have a high volume of data or a need for real-time processing, you may want to consider Solution Three, which uses an event-driven architecture.
