# Event Driven Solution Using Apache Kafka
This solution makes use of an event-driven architecture, where events (i.e. new user-segment pairs) are sent to a message queue (in this case Apache Kafka) for processing. This allows for scalable, parallel processing of the data, which is especially important as the number of users and segments grows.

## Here is a high-level overview of the architecture:

1. The User Segmentation Service (USS) sends a message containing a new user-segment pair to Apache Kafka.
2. A consumer of the Apache Kafka topic processes the message and updates the counts for each segment in a database (for example InfluxDB). This consumer can be run in parallel across multiple instances to handle high volumes of data.
3. A separate process periodically retrieves the segment counts from the database and updates a Redis cache.
4. The Endpoint Service (ES) retrieves the segment counts from the Redis cache and returns them in response to the user's request.
5. To ensure high availability and scalability, this architecture can be deployed using a load balancer, such as HAProxy, to distribute the incoming user requests to multiple instances of the Endpoint Service. Additionally, the consumer and cache update processes can be run on a Kubernetes cluster, which provides automatic scaling and management of the resources.

This solution provides several benefits over traditional monolithic architectures. First, the use of Apache Kafka allows for asynchronous, parallel processing of the user-segment pairs, which is essential for handling high volumes of data. Second, the use of a cache (Redis) allows for quick retrieval of the segment counts, while the use of a database (InfluxDB) provides a persistent storage solution that can handle large amounts of data. Finally, the use of Kubernetes provides automatic scaling and management of the resources, which helps ensure high availability and scalability.
