# User Segmentation System with InfluxDB, Redis, Load Balancer, Kubernetes, and Golang
## Introduction
In this solution, we will implement a User Segmentation System (USS) to store and retrieve the number of active users in each segment. The system will make use of InfluxDB for long-term storage and Redis for caching. Load balancing will be added to improve performance, and the system will be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster for easy scaling. All implementation will be done in Golang.

## Architecture
The architecture of the system will consist of the following components:

1. InfluxDB for long-term storage of user segments and counts. InfluxDB is a time series database and is suitable for storing time-stamped data. It also has built-in retention policies to automatically expire data after a certain amount of time, eliminating the need to manually archive data.

2. Redis for caching the user counts by segment. Redis is an in-memory data store that provides fast access to data. It will be used to store the current counts of active users in each segment, reducing the number of queries to InfluxDB and improving overall performance.

3. Load Balancer to distribute incoming requests evenly among multiple instances of the USS. This will help to avoid overloading any single instance and improve the overall performance and reliability of the system.

4. Kubernetes to manage the deployment and scaling of the USS instances. Kubernetes will make it easy to add new instances as needed, ensuring that the system can scale to meet growing demands.

### Retention Policy
InfluxDB will be used to store the user segments and counts, and it will be configured with a retention policy to automatically expire data after two weeks. This means that after two weeks, the data for an inactive user will be automatically removed from the database.

### Updating the Cache
To update the Redis cache, a periodic job will be set up in Kubernetes to retrieve the latest counts from InfluxDB and store them in Redis. This job will run at a configurable interval, ensuring that the cache always contains the latest information.

### Retrieving User Counts
To retrieve the number of active users in a specific segment, the USS will first check the Redis cache for the count. If the count is not found in the cache, the USS will retrieve it from InfluxDB and store it in the cache for future queries.

### Storing New User Segments
To store a new pair of user and segment, the USS will write the data to both InfluxDB and Redis. The InfluxDB write will include a timestamp indicating when the data will expire (i.e. after two weeks). The Redis write will update the count for the specified segment.

### Load Balancing
To improve performance, a load balancer will be used to distribute incoming requests evenly among multiple instances of the USS. The load balancer will help to avoid overloading any single instance, ensuring that the system remains responsive even under heavy load.

### Scaling
The USS can be easily scaled by adding new instances. The Kubernetes cluster will automatically distribute incoming requests among the available instances, ensuring that the system can handle growing demands. Additionally, the use of InfluxDB and Redis will allow the system to scale horizontally, providing improved performance and reliability.
